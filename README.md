# NodeJS Twitter Bot (Twibby)

## Project Details
This is a project where I will learn to work with the Twitter API and create bots that will accomplish minor small tasks.
Feel free to follow this project to see my progress and feel free to fork or grab little bits of the code!

## Using Twibby
If you would like your own version of Twibby:

1. Fork or Clone the repo
2. [Create New App Application](https://apps.twitter.com/) via Twitter API
3. `npm install`
4. Create your own `config.js` using `sample.config.js` as a reference [just rename to `config.js`]
5. `node [FILENAME]`
6. Have fun && Keep building!
