# NodeJS Twitter Bot (Twibby)

## Project Details
This is a project where I will learn to work with the Twitter API and create bots that will accomplish minor small tasks.
Feel free to follow this project to see my progress and feel free to fork or grab little bits of the code!

1. `Fork or Clone the repo`

3. `npm install twitter`
4. `npm init`
5. Create your own `config.js`
6. `node app.js` or whatever you've set as your entry point
7. Have fun && Keep building!
